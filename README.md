# Credit Risk Modeling

This project focuses on building a credit risk model to predict the likelihood of customer default based on their data. It involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and expected loss calculation.

## Project Overview

Credit risk modeling is crucial for financial institutions to assess and manage the risk associated with lending. This project aims to develop a robust model that accurately predicts whether a customer will repay a loan or default.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We analyze customer data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors.
2. **Feature Engineering:** We apply statistical tests and domain expertise to select the most significant features related to credit risk.
3. **Model Development:** We implement machine learning models to estimate the probability of default (PD).
4. **Model Validation:** We evaluate model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
5. **Expected Loss Calculation:** We compute the total expected loss (EL) using the formula: `EL = PD × LGD × EAD`, where LGD is the Loss Given Default and EAD is the Exposure at Default.

## Expected Loss Calculation

The total expected loss (EL) is a critical metric in credit risk management. It represents the anticipated financial loss due to customer defaults. We calculate EL using the following formula:

where:

* **PD (Probability of Default):** The likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.
* **LGD (Loss Given Default):** The proportion of the exposure that is lost if a borrower defaults.
* **EAD (Exposure at Default):** The total value a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults.

## Model Performance

We evaluate the performance of our credit risk model using various metrics, including:

* **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances (default or non-default).
* **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
* **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
* **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between default and non-default customers.

## Usage

To use this credit risk model:

1. Prepare your customer data in the required format.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Input the customer data into the model to predict the probability of default (PD).
4. Calculate the expected loss (EL) using the PD, LGD, and EAD values.
5. Use the risk assessment insights to make informed financial decisions.
