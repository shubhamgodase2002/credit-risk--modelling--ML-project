A predictive credit risk modeling project leverages machine learning to assess the likelihood of customer default based on two datasets: 1) bureau datasets and 2) internal product datasets. The target variable is multiclass, representing different levels of risk appetite: P1 = very good customer (loan approval), P2 = good but not as good as P1, P3 = good but not as good as P2, and P4 = not a good customer (low priority level). The goal of the machine learning model is to classify customers into these risk categories to support decision-making in loan approvals. The modeling pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model training. Model evaluation is typically performed using metrics such as AUC-ROC and accuracy, while the final model can be deployed to calculate Total Expected Loss (TEL = PD × LGD × EAD).
